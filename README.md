# Bluejay Natural Gas Project Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on **capital budgeting and resource allocation** for a hypothetical natural gas company, Bluejay Natural Gas. The goal is to maximize **Net Present Value (NPV)** while staying within budget constraints and ensuring functional area project requirements are met.

The analysis is performed entirely in **Excel**, using formulas and modeling techniques to evaluate project feasibility, optimize capital expenditure, and assign managers efficiently.

---

## Key Objectives
- Evaluate **12 potential projects** across 3 functional areas (FA 1â€“3) based on NPV.
- Filter projects according to:
  - **Annual capital expenditure constraints**
  - **Total company budget**
  - **Functional area project minimum requirements**
- Optimize **manager assignments** to approved projects while maximizing total approved NPV.

## Methodology
**Step 1: Initial Project Filtering**
   - Adjusted CapEx based on partnership %
   - Calculated **Total Cost**, **New NPV**, and **ROI**
   - Applied budget and requirement checks to determine **approved projects**
   - Result: 9 projects approved, filtering out projects 1, 10, and 12

**Step 2: Manager Assignment**
   - Assigned **8 managers** to projects based on availability
   - Ensured all approved projects have at least one manager
   - Result: Project 3 filtered out due to manager availability
   - Final approved projects maximize **Total NPV = $1,953.8 million**
